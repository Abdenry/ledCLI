# LED CLI: Using FreeRTOS to toggle an LED
My own "Hello World" project to dive into learning about STM32 micro-controllers and intergrating FreeRTOS into projects. Accomplished all by directly manipulating the chip registers, no HAL is used! 

This project specifically is built for the STM32H753 Nucleo Board and uses the appropriate CMSIS files.
